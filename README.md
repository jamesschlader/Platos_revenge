# Word-Guess-Game

This is essentially a classic Hangman game in which the user is trying to spell out a word before they have their "body" hanging from the gallows. Each incorrect guess earns one more body part added to the gallows.

This game follows a theme of classic philosophy. It asserts, counter-factually, that Socrates' follows rose up in revolution at his execution. They then forced the population to prove their philosophical bona-fides by spelling out words.

Letters are selected from the keyboard and displayed on the screen. The word is revealed as successful guesses are made and body part names are revealed on incorrect guesses. The player can see which letters have been chosen by consulting the revealed word and the discard area that holds already guessed letters. The game provides some text feedback after each guess and after wins or losses. The total number of wins and losses are also displayed on the screen.

My plans for future versions are (1) to offer a keyboard of letters that can be clicked or dragged and dropped to a target area in addition to using the keyboard as a means for selecting guesses; (2) adding CSS animation to enliven the display.
