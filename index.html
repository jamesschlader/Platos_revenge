            <h5>After Socrates was unjustly executed by a rigged court, zealous follows took over Greece in order to exact revenge. The fascist mob rounded up anyone they thought might have done harm to Plato or his students and subjected them to "tests."</h5>
            <h5>One of these tests is reproduced here so that you can experience for yourself the wrath of Philosophers gone mad with revenge!</h5>
